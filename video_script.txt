**Video Script: Win or Learn**

**Total Duration:** 30 seconds

**(0-3 seconds)**
*   **Visual:** Opens with a dynamic shot of someone facing a challenge (e.g., a rock climber hesitating, an artist staring at a blank canvas). Upbeat, inspiring music begins softly.
*   **Narrator (Warm, confident voice):** "Ever feel that sting of '''failure'''?"

**(3-10 seconds)**
*   **Visual:** Quick cuts: The climber finds a new hold; the artist makes a bold first stroke. Text overlay: "MISTAKES" briefly appears, then morphs into "LESSONS".
*   **Narrator:** "But what if every stumble was actually a step forward?"

**(10-20 seconds)**
*   **Visual:** Split screen. One side shows "WINNING" (e.g., reaching the summit, completing the artwork). The other side shows "LEARNING" (e.g., studying a new technique, analyzing a past attempt).
*   **Narrator:** "Because there are only two outcomes: You either win, achieving your goal..."

**(20-27 seconds)**
*   **Visual:** The two sides of the screen merge, showing the individual looking empowered, now equipped with new knowledge or success. The inspiring music swells.
*   **Narrator:** "...or you learn, gaining invaluable wisdom that paves the way for your next victory."

**(27-30 seconds)**
*   **Visual:** Final text on screen: "We never fail. We either WIN or LEARN." (Brand logo/channel name can appear subtly).
*   **Narrator:** "So keep pushing. Keep growing. You'''ve got this."
*   **(Music fades out with a final uplifting note.)**
